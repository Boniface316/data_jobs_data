# Scraped Job Data 


Click [Here](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data/raw/master/DataAnalyst.csv) for the Data Anaylst jobs dataset.   This will be updated with more job data, and more diverse job data as I scrape it.  

The glass_scraper scrapes a well known job site.  Has the ability to scrape thousands of jobs.   Please let me know if there are any errors, or just inefficient code you see.  There is still a lot that can be done with this to make it better.  


## Thanks

* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) - A tool designed for QA testing, but that actually works great for making these types of bots
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/doc) - A tool to scrape HTML/XML content (that saved be *big time* with this project)
